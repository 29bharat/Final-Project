# UCB Extension Data Analytics Bootcamp Final Project  
## *Presented by Bharat Aggarwal, Kate Beliankova, Helen Nguyen-Quach, & Christian Radomski*

### Communication
* Messaging through Slack to discuss meeting times and share ideas
* Zoom Meeting on Tuesday, May 26 @ 7 pm to discuss role division and initial topic exploration
* Zoom Meeting on Wednesday, May 27 @ 7 pm to discuss datasets we have found and narrow down topic ideas
* Zoom Meeting on Thursday, May 27 @ 6:45 pm to finalize data set before class. During class we presented a pitch of our project.
* Zoom Meeting on Saturday, May 30 @ 7:00 pm to give update on deliverables
* Zoom Meeting on Sunday, May 31 @ 7:00 pm to go over requirements for deliverable and goals for next week
* Zoom Meeting on Wednesday, June 3 @ 7:00 pm to discuss roles for the next two weeks. Decided to hold the same roles from previous week.
* Class Meeting on Thursday June 4 @ 7:00 pm discussed during class plan to go forward with finalizing dataset, starting presentation, and discussing what visulizations to create.
* Zoom Meeting on Monday June 8 @ 9:00 pm to finalize features that will be used on predictive modeling. Decided on "Function" column.
* Class Meeting on Thursday June 11 @ 7:00 pm to share progress for deliverables due this week. Half of visualizations are complete and final dataset has been cleaned and should be ready for modeling. Received feedback on segment 1 deliverables and we need to connect machine learning model to a database.

### Topic: High School Graduation Rates Based on District Funding Patterns
We will be analyzing California school district data for the school years 2012 through 2017 to determine if there is a relation between district funding patterns and student success. We will measure student success by taking student enrollment and graduation amounts to determine graduation rate. Our steps for this project include attaining data from various years of school district data from a reliable source, cleaning the data to fit the parameters of our model, testing our model, and making a conclusion of our analysis on whether our hypothesis can be supported. Our goal is that our findings will help school districts in determining what programs to invest funds into.

### Data Source
The data that is being used in this analysis will be attained from the California Department of Education. 
* Datasets for CA Enrollment https://www.cde.ca.gov/ds/sd/sd/filesenr.asp
* Datasets for CA Graduation by Race and Gender https://www.cde.ca.gov/ds/sd/sd/filesgrads.asp
* Datasets for CA Annual Financial Data https://www.cde.ca.gov/ds/fd/fd/

### Research Questions
* Does school funding directly correlate to school performance? 
* Do the spending patterns of a school district impact student success/graduation rate?

### Technologies Used
We have used quite a few technologies in this project so far. Below is a list of the same: 
* Slack and Zoom for Communication within the team
* Google Search Engine was used to explore data options
* Github to consolidate each member's work and merge to the master repository.
* Quickdatabasediagrams(https://www.quickdatabasediagrams.com/) to create the schema.
* Postgresql to load the data into the tables as per the schema defined.
* Python with Jupyter Notebook to draft the code and analyse the collected School data.
* Within python following modules were imported - Pandas, sklearn - Kmeans,sklearn - StandardScaler, sklearn - PCA, hvplot and plotlyexpress to conduct cluster analysis.
* For Prediction modelling, python modules were imported in jupyter notebook such as pandas, sklearn - StandardScaler,sklearn - OneHotEncoder, sklearn - train_test_split and tensorflow.
* We have also used ANOVA, where in we imported pandas, numpy, scipy stats and within stats we imported statsmodels.formula.api and statsmodels.api.
