### Topic: High School Graduation Rates Based on District Funding Patterns
We will be analyzing California school district data to determine if there is a relation between district funding patterns and student success. We will take steps to attain data from various years of school district data from a reliable source, clean the data to fit the parameters of our model, test our model, and make a conclusion of our analysis on whether our hypothesis can be supported. Our goal is that our findings will help school districts in determining what programs to invest funds into.

### Data Source
The data that is being used in this analysis will be attained from the California Department of Education. 
* Datasets for CA Enrollment https://www.cde.ca.gov/ds/sd/sd/filesenr.asp
* Datasets for CA Graduation by Race and Gender https://www.cde.ca.gov/ds/sd/sd/filesgrads.asp
* Datasets for CA Annual Financial Data https://www.cde.ca.gov/ds/fd/fd/
  
### Technologies Used
We have used quite a few technologies in this project so far. Below is a list of the same: 
* Slack and Zoom for Communication within the team
* Google Search Engine was used to explore data options
* Github to consolidate each member's work and merge to the master repository.
* Quickdatabasediagrams.com to create the schema.
* Python with Jupyter Notebook to draft the code and analyse the collected School data.
* Within python following modules were imported - Pandas, sklearn - Kmeans,sklearn - StandardScaler, sklearn - PCA, hvplot and plotlyexpress to conduct cluster analysis.
* For Prediction modelling, python modules were imported in jupyter notebook such as pandas, sklearn - StandardScaler,sklearn - OneHotEncoder, sklearn - train_test_split and tensorflow.
* We have also used ANOVA, where in we imported pandas, numpy, scipy stats and within stats we imported statsmodels.formula.api and statsmodels.api.

### Research Questions
* Does school funding directly correlate to school performance? 
* Do the spending patterns of a school district impact student success?
