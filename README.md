### Topic: High School Graduation Rates Based on District Funding Patterns
We will be analyzing California school district data to determine if there is a relation between district funding patterns and student success. Our goal is that our findings will help school districts in determining what programs to invest funds into.

### Data Source
The data that is being used in this analysis will be attained from the California Department of Education. 
* Datasets for CA Enrollment https://www.cde.ca.gov/ds/sd/sd/filesenr.asp
* Datasets for CA Graduation by Race and Gender https://www.cde.ca.gov/ds/sd/sd/filesgrads.asp
* Datasets for CA Annual Financial Data https://www.cde.ca.gov/ds/fd/fd/

### Research Questions
* Does school funding directly correlate to school performance? 
* What program areas should be funded to create the greatest impact?
